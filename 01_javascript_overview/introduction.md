### What is JavaScript?
Javascript is a lightweight, interpreted programming language with object oriented capabilities.

#### Advantages of JavaScript
1. **Less server interraction** - You can validate user input before sending the page
off to the server. This saves server traffic, which means less load on your
server.
2. **Immediate feedback to the visitors**: They don't have to wait for a page
reload to see if they have forgotten to enter something.
3. **Increased interactivity**: You can create interfaces that react when the user
hovers over them with a mouse or activates them via the keyboard.
4. **Richer interfaces**: You can use JavaScript to include such items as drag-anddrop components and sliders to give a Rich Interface to your site visitors.

#### Limitations of JavaScript

1. Client-side JavaScript does not allow the reading or writing of files. This has
been kept for security reason.
2. JavaScript cannot be used for networking applications because there is no such
support available.
3. JavaScript doesn't have any multithreading or multiprocessor capabilities.
