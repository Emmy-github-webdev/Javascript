# The for Loop

The ‘for’ loop is the most compact form of looping. It includes the following
three important parts:
1. The **loop initialization** where we initialize our counter to a starting
value. The initialization statement is executed before the loop begins.
2. The **test statement** which will test if a given condition is true or not. If
the condition is true, then the code given inside the loop will be executed,
otherwise the control will come out of the loop.
3. The **iteration statement** where you can increase or decrease your
counter.
```
for (initialization; test condition; iteration statement){
 Statement(s) to be executed if test condition is true
}
```
