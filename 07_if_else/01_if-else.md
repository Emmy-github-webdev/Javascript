# IF-ELSE

JavaScript supports conditional statements which are used to perform different
actions based on different conditions. Here we will explain the
**if..else** statement.

### FlowChartof if-else

The following flow chart shows how the if-else statement works.

##### if Statement

```
if (expression){
 Statement(s) to be executed if expression is true
}

```

##### if...else Statement
The ‘if...else’ statement is the next form of control statement that allows
JavaScript to execute statements in a more controlled way.
```
if (expression){
 Statement(s) to be executed if expression is true
}else{
 Statement(s) to be executed if expression is false
}

```

##### if...else if... Statement

}else if (expression 2){
