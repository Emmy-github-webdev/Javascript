# FUNCTIONS

A function is a group of reusable code which can be called anywhere in your
program. This eliminates the need of writing the same code again and again. It
helps programmers in writing modular codes. Functions allow a programmer to
divide a big program into a number of small and manageable functions.

#### Function Definition
```
<script type="text/javascript">
<!--
function functionname(parameter-list)
{
 statements
}
//-->
</script>

```

#### The return Statement

A JavaScript function can have an optional return statement. This is required if
you want to return a value from a function. This statement should be the last
statement in a function.
