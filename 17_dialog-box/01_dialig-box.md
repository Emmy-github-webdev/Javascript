# DIALOG BOX

JavaScript supports three important types of dialog boxes. These dialog boxes
can be used to raise and alert, or to get confirmation on any input or to have a
kind of input from the users. Here we will discuss each dialog box one by one.

#### Alert Dialog Box

An alert dialog box is mostly used to give a warning message to the users. Nonetheless, an alert box can still be used for friendlier messages. Alert box
gives only one button "OK" to select and proceed.

#### Confirmation Dialog Box

A confirmation dialog box is mostly used to take user's consent on any option. It
displays a dialog box with two buttons: **OK** and **Cancel**.

If the user clicks on the OK button, the window method **confirm()** will return
true. If the user clicks on the Cancel button, then **confirm()** returns false.
