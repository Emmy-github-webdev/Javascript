## JavaScript Syntax

Javascript can be implemented by placing javascript statement within the <script> ...</script> HTML tags in the web page.

The script tag consists of two attributes
1. Language which specifies what scripting language you are using.
2. Type which is what is now recommended to indicate the scripting
language in use and its value should be set to "text/javascript"
