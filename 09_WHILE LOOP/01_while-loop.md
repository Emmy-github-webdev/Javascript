# The while Loop

The most basic loop in JavaScript is the while loop which would be discussed in
this chapter. The purpose of a while loop is to execute a statement or code
block repeatedly as long as an expression is true. Once the expression
becomes false, the loop terminates.

```
while (expression){
 Statement(s) to be executed if expression is true
}
```

### The do...whileLoop

The do...while loop is similar to the while loop except that the condition check
happens at the end of the loop. This means that the loop will always be executed
at least once, even if the condition is false.
```
do{
 Statement(s) to be executed;
} while (expression);
```
