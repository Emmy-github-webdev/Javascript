# The while Loop

The most basic loop in JavaScript is the while loop which would be discussed in
this chapter. The purpose of a while loop is to execute a statement or code
block repeatedly as long as an expression is true. Once the expression
becomes false, the loop terminates.

```
while (expression){
 Statement(s) to be executed if expression is true
}
```
