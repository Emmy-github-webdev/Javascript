# What is an Operator?

For example 4 + 5 is equal to 9.

<br>

Here 4 and 5 are **operand**, while **+** is called **operator**

<br>

Javascript support the following types of operators

1. Arithmetic operator
2. Comparison operator
3. Logical operator
4. Conditional (or ternary) operator
5. Assignment operator

### Arithmetic Operator

| S. No. | Operator and Description |
| ------ | ------------------------ |
| 1 | + (Addition) Adds two operands. Ex: A + B will give 30 |
| 2 | - (Subtraction) Subtracts the second operand from the first. Ex: A - B will give -10 |
| 3 | * (Multiplication) Multiply both operands. Ex: A * B will give 200 |
| 4 | / (Division) Divide the numerator by the denominator. Ex: B / A will give 2 |
| 5 | A % (Modulus) Outputs the remainder of an integer division. Ex: B % A will give 0 |
| 6 | ++ (Increment) Increases an integer value by one. Ex: A++ will give 11 |
| 7 | -- (Decrement) Decreases an integer value by one. Ex: A-- will give 9 |

### Comparison Operators

| S. No. | Operator and Description |
| ------ | ------------------------ |
| 1 | == (Equal) Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not, if yes, then the condition becomes true. Ex: (A == B) is not true. |
| 2 | != (Not Equal) Checks if the value of two operands are equal or not, if the values are not equal, then the condition becomes true. Ex: (A != B) is true. 
|

| 3 | > (Greater than) Checks if the value of the left operand is greater than the value of the right operand, if yes, then the condition becomes true. Ex: (A > B) is not true. |
| 4 | < (Less than) Checks if the value of the left operand is less than the value of the right operand, if yes, then the condition becomes true. Ex: (A < B) is true. |
| 5 | >= (Greater than or Equal to) Checks if the value of the left operand is greater than or equal to the value of the right operand, if yes, then the condition becomes true. Ex: (A >= B) is not true. |
| 6 | <= (Less than or Equal to) Checks if the value of the left operand is less than or equal to the value of the right operand, if yes, then the condition becomes true. Ex: (A <= B) is true. |
