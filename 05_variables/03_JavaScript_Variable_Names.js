/*
 * JavaScript Variable Names
  While naming your variables in JavaScript, keep the following rules in mind.

  1. You should not use any of the JavaScript reserved keywords as a variable
    name. These keywords are mentioned in the next section. For example,
    break or boolean variable names are not valid.
  2.JavaScript variable names should not start with a numeral (0-9). They
    must begin with a letter or an underscore character. For
    example, 123test is an invalid variable name but _123test is a valid
    one.
  3. JavaScript variable names are case-sensitive. For example, Name and
    name are two different variables.
