1. **[What is node.js?](https://www.freecodecamp.org/news/node-js-what-when-where-why-how-ab8424886e2/)**
  _Answer_
  **node.js** is a server side scripting which is used to build scalable programs. The advantages of **Node.js** over other scripting language includes
  - Node.js is a JavaScript runtime built on Chrome's V8 JavaScript engine
  - Node.js uses an event driven, asynchronous, non-blocking I/O model
  - Node.js operate on a single thread event loop
  > I/O (Input/Output)
  **I/O** refers to the program's interaction with the system's disk and network. Examples includes Reading/Writing data from/to disk, making HTTP request, and talking to the database.
  > Synchronous
  **Synchronous** execution usually refers to code executing in sequence. In Synchronous programming, the program is executed line by line at a time.
  > Asynchronous
  **Asynchronous** execution usually refers to code not executing in the sequence it appears in the code. In async programming the program doesn't wait for the task to complete and can move on to the next task.
  ```
  // Synchronous: 1,2,3
  alert(1);
  alert(2);
  alert(3);

  // Asynchronous: 1,3,2
  alert(1);
  setTimeout(() => alert(2), 0);
  alert(3);
  ```
  > Blocking VS Non-blocking
  **Blocking** refers to operations that block further execution until that operation finishes. It execute **synchronously** while **Non-blocking** refers to operations that does not block execution. **Non-blocking** execute **asynchrously**

  ```
  // Blocking
  const fs = require('fs');
  const data = fs.readFileSync('/file.md'); // blocks here until file is read
  console.log(data);
  moreWork(); // will run after console.log

  // Non-blocking
  const fs = require('fs');
  fs.readFile('/file.md', (err, data) => {
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log(data);
  });
  moreWork(); // will run before console.log
  ```
  > Callback
  A **Callback** is a function passed into another function as an argument, which can be invoked or callback inside the outer function to complete some kind of action at a convenient time.
  ```
  // Sync callback
  function greetings(callback) {
    callback();
  }
  greetings(() => { console.log('Hi'); });
  moreWork(); // will run after console.log

  // Async callback
  const fs = require('fs');
  fs.readFile('/file.md', function callback(err, data) { // fs.readFile is an async method provided by Node
    if (err) throw err;
    console.log(data);
  });
  moreWork(); // will run before console.log
  ```
  > Callback hell
  **Callback hell** is a situation where callbacks are nested within another callbacks several levels deep, making the code difficult to understand, maintain and debug.

  > Event and event-driven programming
  **Events** are actions generated by the user or the system, like click, file download, hardware or software erorr.
  **Event-driven programming** is a programming in which the flow of the program is determined by events. An **event-driven programming** performs actions in response to events. It is divided into two section: event selection, and event handling.

  > [Event Loop](https://nodejs.org/de/docs/guides/event-loop-timers-and-nexttick/#what-is-the-event-loop)
  The **event loop** is what allows Node.js to perform non-blocking I/O operation desite JavaScript is single-threaded.

  ```
  const fs = require('fs');

  function someAsyncOperation(callback) {
    // Assume this takes 95ms to complete
    fs.readFile('/path/to/file', callback);
  }

  const timeoutScheduled = Date.now();

  setTimeout(() => {
    const delay = Date.now() - timeoutScheduled;

    console.log(`${delay}ms have passed since I was scheduled`);
  }, 100);

  // do someAsyncOperation which takes 95 ms to complete
  someAsyncOperation(() => {
    const startCallback = Date.now();

    // do something that will take 10ms...
    while (Date.now() - startCallback < 10) {
      // do nothing
    }
  });
  ```
2. Where can we use node.js?
  Answer:
  - Web applications
  - Network applications
  - Distributed system
  - General purpose application
3. Advantages of using node.js?
  - It provides easy way to build scalable network programs
  - Great concurrency
  - Generally fast
  - Asynchronous everything
  - Almost never blocks
4. What are the two types of API functions in Node.js?
  Answer:
  - Asynchronous, non-blocking functions
  - Synchronous, blocking functions
5. What is control flow function?
  Answer:
  Control flow function is generic piece of code which runs in between several Asynchrounous function
